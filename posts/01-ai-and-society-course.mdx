The course Artificial Intelligence in the Social-Ecological Sphere examines the profound social and environmental implications of AI technologies, equipping students with critical analytical tools to evaluate AI solutions in sustainability contexts. Through a comprehensive exploration of the complex interplay between society, environment, and technology, students will investigate how social processes shape technological development and how AI, in turn, embodies power relations and transforms social interactions. The course pays particular attention to how machine learning algorithms may reflect and amplify social phenomena, accelerate global processes, and potentially exacerbate social disparities. Students will grapple with fundamental philosophical questions surrounding AI, including issues of control, ethics, and identity, while examining the AI alignment problem and the challenges of identifying artificial intelligence in various scenarios. Throughout the semester, students will engage critically with a central question: Can artificial intelligence be effectively harnessed to promote a fair and sustainable human future? By combining technical understanding with social and ecological perspectives, this course prepares students to thoughtfully navigate the intersection of AI technology and sustainability challenges.
