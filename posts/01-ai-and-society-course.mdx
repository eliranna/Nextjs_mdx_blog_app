The course *Artificial Intelligence in the Social-Ecological Sphere* will explore the social and environmental implications of artificial intelligence, equipping students with tools for critical analysis of AI solutions in the context of sustainability. To this end, we will examine the complex relationships forming between society, environment, and technology. We will investigate how social processes shape technological development, and how technology, in turn, embodies power relations and reshapes social interactions. Special emphasis will be given to understanding how deep learning algorithms may echo and even intensify social phenomena, accelerate global processes, and deepen social gaps. We will also address the central philosophical issues arising in the context of artificial intelligence regarding control, ethics, and identity. Among other topics, we will highlight the AI alignment problem and the difficulty in identifying artificial intelligence in certain scenarios. Ultimately, the course challenges students to critically engage with the question: Can artificial intelligence promote a fair and sustainable human future?
