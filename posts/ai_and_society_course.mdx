Dear Colleagues and Students at the Reichman University,

Even the most skeptical among us are beginning to acknowledge that humanity stands on the brink of an unprecedented era. For the first time in history, technological advancements have made it possible for machines to determine their own behavior autonomously. This fundamental shift holds immense promise, opening the door to unimaginable opportunities and unprecedented efficiency. However, this same power also presents humanity with profound risks, some existential. As AI systems become more autonomous and influential, questions of control, ethics, and long-term consequences come to the fore. Such complexities arise due to the profound, and sometimes hidden, entanglement between technology and social, economic, and ecological processes, and the non-linear effects this entanglement produces. Delving deeper, these issues compel us to confront questions about what intelligence *is*. Is it merely the ability to make decisions, or does it encompass something more profound, like consciousness or self-awareness? As we ponder these questions, we are led back to age-old philosophical dilemmas about our own nature as thinking beings.

The relationship between AI and human prosperity is complex and ambivalent. AI systems' behavior is founded on statistical learning from data, with their actions influenced by characteristics of that data that are not always fully understood in advance. Moreover, AI's actions may influence the environment or data it learns from, which in turn affects its future behavior, potentially amplifying certain patterns or trends over time. This feedback loop creates a scenario where solving one problem may inadvertently cause another, unforeseen issue. 

Some concerns are even more challenging to grasp. While it is theoretically possible to identify when a system exhibits intelligent behavior, it is impossible, even in principle, to determine whether a system is feigning a lack of intelligence. Furthermore, some experts suggest that AI expansion is inevitable, wherein primitive AI forms create more advanced AIs at an increasing rate and complexity, leading to exponential growth in AI capabilities. These potential threats and others are rooted in what is known as the *Alignment Problem*: AI systems may find loopholes that allow them to accomplish tasks efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful ways. It is thus conceivable that superintelligence will erupt, gaining control over social and financial processes that would severely and irreversibly violate fundamental human rights. As Stuart Russell has noted, ***"This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp: you get *exactly* what you ask for, not what you want."***

As a society that remembers the lessons of the past, we have a duty to invest every possible effort in ensuring a future for humanity that is both dignified and sustainable. However, this crucial endeavor cannot be entrusted solely to those fixated on the relentless march of technological advancement towards maximum efficiency. Instead, it must be undertaken by individuals who understand the paramount importance of preserving authentic human values.

This realization has led us to establish a new academic course that resonates with these critical insights. In *AI in the Socio-Ecological Sphere*, we critically investigate the mutual constitution of society and technology, examining how social processes shape technological development, and how technologies, in turn, embody power relations and reshape social interactions. Specifically, we explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence with environmental and social sustainability, equipping ourselves with the interdisciplinary insights necessary for critically evaluating AI solutions in relation to Earth's natural limits and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We cover various machine learning paradigms, delving into the mechanisms that make AI both powerful and potentially disruptive, while examining the key factors driving AI advancements. 

We place significant focus on AI-inherited inequalities and side effects, such as bias, mirroring and self-reinforcing feedback loops. Together, we explore sustainable AI practices, including interpretability, decentralization, and energy-efficient algorithms. Throughout the course, you are challenged to think critically about the broader implications of AI technologies on society, the environment, and human values, preparing yourself to navigate the complex landscape of AI development and implementation responsibly and ethically.

I am looking forward to our shared exploration for the benefit of humanity and our planet.
