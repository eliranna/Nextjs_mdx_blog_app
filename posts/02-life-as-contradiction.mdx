### Life and Self-organization

The second law of Termosynamics suggests that the universe’s natural inclination is towards distraction: As chaos is more probable than order, any ordered structure must dissolve in time. This is because the number of possible states of a thing in which it is anything but this specific orderly shape is infinitely larger than the small group of states in which the thing exists in such order. Thus, given a thing that is ordered somehow, and given enough time, the probability of the thing to remain in an orderly structure is essentially zero. 

Different to all things is the Organisem, which defines the second law of Termosynamics in its ability to self-orginze. In the face of the environment attempting to dissolve it, unite it with itself, the organizem is able to continuously and proactively react, changing itself and its environment in order to preserve itself from inalihation. As per the second law of thermodynamics, closed systems inevitably tend towards a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. By contrast, living systems are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their environments to maintain themselves in a nonequilibrium steady state, often described in biological terms as homeostasis. Even when the individual organism is no longer capable of properly reacting to the universe's flactionations and thus dies, it is likely that it has proactivly produce other individuals in his own image which then proceed the organism's existence; reproduction is a proactive action of self preservation.

But what is self-organization exactly? The free energy principle (FEP), primarily developed by neuroscientist Karl Friston, proposes a fundamental explanation for how systems maintain their organization over time. According to the FEP, all persistent physical systems—from single cells to complex organisms and even social structures—obey an imperative to minimize variational free energy. In essence, this means that a self-orgenizing system must maintain a predictive model of its own sensory states and constantly work to reduce the model's surprisal, which is a measure of how unexpected or improbable its sensory inputs are.
