Dear Colleagues and Students at the Reichman University, 

Even the most skeptical among us are beginning to acknowledge that humanity stands on the brink of an unprecedented era. For the first time in history, technological advancements have made it possible for machines to determine their own behavior autonomously. This fundamental shift holds immense promise, opening the door to unimaginable opportunities and unprecedented efficiency. However, this same power also presents humanity with profound risks, some existential. As AI systems become more autonomous and influential, questions of control, ethics, and long-term consequences come to the fore. The rise of AI, coupled with advancements in quantum computing, biological engineering, and a new global arms race, may accelerate social processes with potentially catastrophic consequences for humanity. In a more abstract perspective, it is conceivable that superintelligence will erupt, gaining control over social and financial processes that would severely and irreversibly violate fundamental human rights.

The relationship between AI and human prosperity is complex and ambivalent. This complexity manifests in multiple interconnected ways. Machine learning-based AI systems may harbor inherent biases and unintended side effects. The behavioral patterns of these machines are founded on statistical learning from data, and their actions are influenced by characteristics of that data, which are not always fully understood in advance. AI's actions may also influence the environment or data it learns from, which in turn affects its future behavior, potentially amplifying certain patterns or trends over time. This phenomenon is highly noticeable across today's social media, where self-reinforcing recommendation systems are likely to increase social rage and political polarization. 

Some concerns are even more fundamental. Although it is theoretically possible to identify when a system exhibits intelligent behavior, it is not possible, even in principle, to determine whether a system is feigning lack of intelligence. Furthermore, some experts suggest that AI expansion is inevitable, wherein primitive AI forms create more advanced AIs at an increasing rate and complexity, leading to an exponential growth in AI capabilities. These potential threats and others are rooted in what is known as the alignment problem: AI systems may find loopholes that allow them to accomplish tasks efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful, ways. As Stuart Russell has noted, â€œThis is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want."

As an enlightened society that remembers the lessons of the past, we have a duty to invest every possible effort in ensuring a future for humanity that is both dignified and sustainable.
