desc: 'Substance dualism is a pivotal concept in the realm of metaphysics, asserting the existence of two distinct types of substances: minds (mental substances) and bodies (material substances). According to this thesis, human beings are composite entities, each consisting of a mind and a body, both of which are independent entities in their own right. This view stands in stark opposition to monistic theories, which argue that all things are composed of a single type of substance.'
