Substance dualism is a pivotal concept in the realm of metaphysics, asserting the existence of two distinct types of substances: minds (mental substances) and bodies (material substances). According to this thesis, human beings are composite entities, each consisting of a mind and a body, both of which are independent entities in their own right. This view stands in stark opposition to monistic theories, which argue that all things are composed of a single type of substance.

# Defining Substance

Philosophically, a substance can be defined in two key ways. Firstly, a substance is the subject of predication, meaning it is the entity to which attributes or predicates such as "blue," "weighs a pound," and "fragile" can be ascribed. Importantly, a substance cannot be predicated of anything else. Secondly, a substance possesses the capacity for independent existence.

René Descartes articulates this notion succinctly: 

"The notion of a substance is just this—that it can exist by itself, that is without the aid of any other substance." 

This definition underscores the autonomous nature of substances, distinguishing them from properties or attributes that cannot exist independently.

To elucidate the concept of substance, consider the example of a vase. The color, shape, and surface of the vase cannot exist independently; they are contingent upon the vase itself. The vase, however, exists as an entity in its own right, demonstrating the essence of substance as something capable of independent existence.

Minds as Substances

Applying this framework to minds, substance dualism posits that minds are substances—autonomous entities akin to material objects, but immaterial in nature. Descartes views minds as entities that possess properties and engage in activities such as thinking, sensing, judging, and willing. Crucially, minds have the capacity for independent existence, implying that there is a conceivable world in which only minds exist, devoid of material bodies. This leads to the conclusion that a mind can exist independently of its corresponding body.
